# Contributing to Nodyx
### Welcome to the Nodyx community

---

> "Nodyx belongs to its community. Not its creators."
> If you're reading this file, you are potentially a builder of the free internet.
> Welcome.

---

## Before you start

Read these files in this order:
1. `ARCHITECTURE.md` — How Nodyx is built
2. `MANIFESTO.md` — The soul of the project
3. `ROADMAP.md` — Where we're going

If you disagree with the Manifesto, Nodyx may not be the right project for you.
And that's okay.

---

## Where to contribute

### You can contribute freely in
```
nodyx-plugins/    — Create plugins
nodyx-themes/     — Create visual themes
nodyx-docs/       — Improve documentation
i18n/             — Translate into your language
community/        — Community content
```

### You cannot modify without validation
```
nodyx-core/src/           — Main server code
nodyx-core/ARCHITECTURE.md
nodyx-core/NODYX_CONTEXT.md
docs/en/MANIFESTO.md
```

If you think something in the core should change, open an Issue and explain why. Discussion is open. Unilateral modification is not.

---

## Creating a plugin

### Minimal structure
```
nodyx-plugins/my-plugin/
├── plugin.json     — Required manifest
├── index.ts        — Entry point
├── README.md       — Documentation
└── LICENSE         — License (MIT recommended)
```

### Minimal plugin.json
```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "What my plugin does",
  "author": "Your name or username",
  "license": "MIT",
  "nodyxVersion": ">=1.0.0"
}
```

### Plugin rules
1. A plugin never modifies core tables (users, communities, categories, threads, posts)
2. A plugin may add its own tables with the prefix `plugin_{name}_`
3. A plugin only uses hooks documented in ARCHITECTURE.md
4. A plugin cannot disable another plugin
5. A plugin must work even if its optional dependencies are absent

---

## Contributing to core code

### Process
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch: `feat/my-feature` or `fix/my-fix`
3. Code in TypeScript, comments in English
4. Tests are required for any new API route
5. Open a Pull Request with a clear description

### Commit format (required)

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add voice channel mute shortcut
fix: correct JWT expiry check
docs: update installation guide
refactor: extract voice signaling to separate module
test: add auth middleware unit tests
chore: update dependencies
```

All commit messages and code comments must be in **English**.

### What we won't merge
- Code without tests
- Code that breaks existing tests
- Code with proprietary dependencies
- Code with backdoors (obviously)
- Code that centralizes user data
- Code that contradicts ARCHITECTURE.md without prior discussion

## Translating Nodyx

Translation is the most accessible contribution. No coding required.

### How to do it
1. Go to `docs/`
2. Copy the `en/` folder and rename it with your language code (`de/`, `es/`, `ja/`, etc.)
3. Translate the files
4. Open a Pull Request

### Files to translate
```
MANIFESTO.md    — The founding text
THANKS.md       — Acknowledgements
README.md       — Project overview
CONTRIBUTING.md — This guide
ARCHITECTURE.md — Technical reference
ROADMAP.md      — Development roadmap
```

### Translation rules
- Translate meaning, not word-for-word
- Keep the original tone (direct, human, not corporate)
- If a concept has no equivalent in your language, keep the English term
- Proper nouns (Nodyx, NodyxPoints, Guard Protocol, etc.) are never translated

---

## Reporting a bug

Open an Issue with:
- The Nodyx version
- The server operating system
- Steps to reproduce
- What you saw vs. what you expected
- Logs if available

---

## Proposing a feature

Open an Issue with the tag `[FEATURE]` and explain:
- What problem it solves
- For whom (what type of user)
- How you imagine it working
- Should it be in the core or a plugin?

The rule: if it can be a plugin, it must be a plugin.

---

## Code of conduct

### We are here to
- Build something good
- Learn together
- Respect others' work
- Critique ideas, not people

### We are not here to
- Impose our technical opinions
- Dismiss others' contributions
- Promote proprietary tools or services
- Circumvent core rules

---

## Questions

- GitHub Issues for bugs and features
- GitHub Discussions for general questions
- The Nodyx forum itself for everything else

---

## Thank you

Every contribution, no matter how small, is part of something larger.
A typo fix in the docs. A translation. A plugin. A reported bug.

Everything counts. Everything is recorded in the history of the project.

```
git log --oneline
```

Your name will be there.
