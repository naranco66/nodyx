# NODYX

> *"The network is the people."*

**Nodyx** is a decentralized, open source, free community communication platform.

It is the internet of the 2000s rebuilt with the tools of 2026.

---

## Why Nodyx exists

Discord, Facebook, and Big Tech have locked millions of communities inside private silos.
Discussions, tutorials, collective knowledge — invisible to Google, inaccessible without an account, condemned to disappear the day the platform shuts down.

**Nodyx fixes that.**

- Public forums **indexed by all search engines** (Google, Bing, Brave, Qwant...)
- Reactions, thanks, tags, full-text search
- Real-time community **chat** (Socket.IO)
- **Voice** + screen sharing (WebRTC P2P)
- **Self-hostable** on any server
- **P2P network** — users are the network
- **Open source** — AGPL-3.0

---

## One instance = one community

Nodyx is not deployed as a multi-community platform.
**Each Nodyx installation is a sovereign community**, configured via `.env`:

```env
NODYX_COMMUNITY_NAME=Linux & Open Source
NODYX_COMMUNITY_DESCRIPTION=The English-speaking free software community.
NODYX_COMMUNITY_LANGUAGE=en
NODYX_COMMUNITY_COUNTRY=US
NODYX_COMMUNITY_SLUG=linux
```

Instances discover each other through the **nodyx-directory** — the global registry *(Phase 2)*.

## Installation

### Option A — Docker (recommended)

The simplest method. Requires Docker Desktop or Docker Engine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pokled/Nodyx
cd Nodyx/nodyx-core
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your community information
docker-compose up -d
```

The API starts on `http://localhost:3000`

---

### Option B — Windows Server without Docker (PowerShell Easy-Install)

A PowerShell script automates the full installation in under 15 minutes:
Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, database configuration, migrations, and registration as a Windows service.

```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator, then:
.\scripts\Install-Nodyx.ps1

# Or with a custom installation path:
.\scripts\Install-Nodyx.ps1 -NodyxPath "D:\Apps\Nodyx"
```

The script automatically installs and configures:
- **Chocolatey** (Windows package manager)
- **Node.js LTS** + **PostgreSQL 16** + **Redis**
- **NSSM** to register Nodyx as a Windows service (auto-start)
- Firewall rule for the API port

---

### Option C — Manual installation (Linux/Mac/Windows)

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, PostgreSQL 16+, Redis 7+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pokled/Nodyx
cd Nodyx/nodyx-core
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your values, then create the database:

```sql
-- As a PostgreSQL superuser
CREATE ROLE nodyx_user LOGIN PASSWORD 'your_password';
CREATE DATABASE nodyx OWNER nodyx_user;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE nodyx TO nodyx_user;
```

Apply migrations:

```bash
# Linux/Mac (peer auth or password)
PGPASSWORD=your_password psql -U nodyx_user -d nodyx -f src/migrations/001_initial.sql
# Migrations are applied automatically at startup — no manual SQL needed

# Windows
$env:PGPASSWORD="your_password"
& "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin\psql.exe" -U nodyx_user -d nodyx -f src\migrations\001_initial.sql
# Migrations are applied automatically at startup — no manual SQL needed
```

Start:

```bash
npm run dev       # development (ts-node, port 3000)
npm run build     # TypeScript compilation
npm start         # production (node dist/)
```

## HTTPS reverse proxy — Caddy (recommended)

[Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) is a reverse proxy that automatically manages SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt. No manual SSL configuration.

```bash
# Install Caddy
choco install caddy       # Windows
apt install caddy         # Debian/Ubuntu
brew install caddy        # macOS

# Run with the example configuration (from repo root)
caddy run --config nodyx-core/scripts/Caddyfile.example
```

An annotated example is available in [`nodyx-core/scripts/Caddyfile.example`](../../nodyx-core/scripts/Caddyfile.example).
