---

## PHASE 3 — P2P Infrastructure + Rust Foundation
### Goal: Break free from third-party network dependencies. Build the decentralized core.

> *"P2P is the soul. Rust is the body."*
>
> Nexus will not replace Node.js or SvelteKit — they do their job perfectly.
> Rust will come **underneath**, invisible to the user, to handle the parts
> that JavaScript can't do well: low-level networking, encryption, WireGuard, DHT.
> The Rust layer communicates with nexus-core via a local Unix socket — simple and decoupled.

---

### 3.0 — `nexus-p2p`: The Rust Foundation 🔨 IN PROGRESS

#### Why Rust here?

Today, a user without a domain and without open ports must:
1. Create a Cloudflare account
2. Add their domain to Cloudflare (requires owning one, ~$1/year)
3. Configure `cloudflared` manually or via `install_tunnel.sh`

That's too much friction. And more importantly: **it's a dependency on a third-party service**,
contrary to Nexus's philosophy.

The Rust layer solves this radically and progressively.

```

#### Phase 3.0-A — `nexus-relay-client` ✅ VALIDATED — March 1, 2026

> Replaces `install_tunnel.sh` + Cloudflare Tunnel. Zero domain required. Zero open ports.
> **Tested in real conditions: Raspberry Pi 4, no open ports, no Cloudflare account.**

- [x] Static Rust binary (9MB) — `tokio` + `hyper` + `tokio-postgres` + `clap` + `dashmap`
- [x] Outbound TCP connection to `relay.nexusnode.app:7443` (our infrastructure)
- [x] Bidirectional HTTP forwarding (JSON framing, 4-byte length prefix)
- [x] Automatic `slug.nexusnode.app` registration without DNS or CF account
- [x] Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → max 30s)
- [x] GitHub Release `v0.1.1-relay` — amd64 + arm64 binaries (fix: concurrent request handling)
- [x] Integration in `install.sh`: option 2 "Nexus Relay (recommended)"
- [x] Client-side systemd service (`nexus-relay-client.service`)

**User result:** `bash install.sh` → choose "Relay" → get `mycommunity.nexusnode.app` **with zero network configuration**.

#### Phase 3.0-B — Browser P2P Nodes (WebRTC DataChannels) ✅ POC VALIDATED — March 2, 2026

> Users' browsers become active relay nodes.
> Direct peer-to-peer communication without server intermediary.
> **Reuses the existing `voice.ts` signaling** — zero new server infrastructure needed.

**Approach:** Native WebRTC DataChannels + existing Socket.IO signaling (voice.ts pattern)
**Not in this POC:** libp2p (overkill), DHT (2027+)

**v0.8 — Two-browser POC ✅:**
- [x] Add `p2p:offer`, `p2p:answer`, `p2p:ice` events to `voice.ts` (3 lines — same pattern as `voice:offer/answer/ice`)
- [x] Create `nexus-frontend/src/lib/p2p.ts` — RTCPeerConnection + DataChannel manager
- [x] Peer discovery via existing Socket.IO (polite/impolite handshake — single initiator only)
- [x] Use instance's own coturn (already installed) — no third-party STUN
- [x] `ondatachannel` handler on responder side (critical — without it, responder never receives the channel)
- [x] UI indicator "⚡ P2P · N" in the text channel header (yellow when active, pulsing gray while connecting)
- [x] Validated test: two browsers, direct DataChannel confirmed, messages not going through server

**User result:** join any text channel → the ⚡ P2P indicator appears automatically when another member is present. Zero configuration.

**v0.9 — 1-N Mesh 🔨 IN PROGRESS:**
- [x] Handle multiple simultaneous peer connections (Map of RTCPeerConnections — already in p2p.ts)
- [x] Instant P2P typing indicators (~1–5ms, animated Discord-style bouncing dots)
- [x] Optimistic reactions + spring physics pop animation (arrives before server roundtrip)
- [ ] Graceful fallback if WebRTC fails (strict NAT, firewall)
- [ ] Asset transfer between peers (download from nearest peer)

#### Phase 3.0-C — `nexus-turn` (replaces coturn)

> coturn is a 2000s C project. Complex to configure, significant attack surface.

- [ ] STUN/TURN server in Rust — RFC 5766 + RFC 8656
- [ ] Dynamic credentials provided by nexus-core via IPC (no static config)
- [ ] Structured logs (JSON), Prometheus metrics
- [ ] ~5MB static, zero configuration at install

#### Phase 3.0-D — `nexus-p2p` core (long-term vision 2027-2028)

> The distributed core. When a node wants to contact another node directly, without going through us.
> Immortal network: every piece of data replicated on 3+ nodes, auto-healing.

- [ ] Kademlia DHT (via `libp2p`) — peer discovery without central server
- [ ] WireGuard (via `wireguard-rs`) — encrypted direct tunnel between voluntary instances
- [ ] Native ICE/STUN — NAT traversal without coturn for P2P connections
- [ ] IPC API exposed to nexus-core: `relay.register(slug)`, `peer.connect(slug)`, `network.peers()`
- [ ] Gossip protocol — natural state propagation across the network
- [ ] CRDTs — conflict-free distributed data (like counters, presence)
- [ ] Replication factor 3 — auto-healing if a node goes down
- [ ] If `nexusnode.app` is unreachable, nodes find each other via DHT (resilience)

---

### 3.1 — Voice Channels — Interface & Advanced Modes
*(network layer already in place — Phase 2.4)*

- [x] VoicePanel sidebar — fixed-position left panel with participant list (Galaxy Bar layout)
- [x] Voice member interaction panel — click any member → real-time network stats (RTT / jitter / packet loss) + volume slider
- [x] Self-monitoring panel — click yourself → live audio level meter, muted / deafened / PTT status badges
- [x] VoiceSettings popup — large fixed-position modal (360px), escapes sidebar overflow with backdrop overlay
- [x] Interaction buttons per peer — Profile link, Direct Message, File sharing + Mini-game (coming soon)
- [ ] Round Table mode — direct WebRTC P2P (2 to 8 people, low latency)
- [ ] Amphitheater mode — 1→N broadcast (9 to 25+ people, video on "screen")
- [ ] Member mini-games — lightweight in-voice games between two members (first: TBD)
- [ ] File sharing between voice members — direct P2P transfer in voice channel
- [ ] Nodes-as-a-Service — a Raspberry Pi can become a media relay to relieve the main server

### 3.2 — Inter-instance mesh network
*(depends on Phase 3.0-C)*

- [ ] WireGuard mesh between voluntary instances — end-to-end encrypted tunnel
- [ ] DHT for peer discovery without a central server
- [ ] Gossip protocol — lightweight metadata synchronization between nodes
- [ ] Distributed backup directory — if `nexusnode.app` goes down, nodes maintain the directory
- [ ] Automatic transition to direct P2P connection when available
- [ ] Lightweight federation — a member of community A can interact with community B

---

## PHASE 4 — Platform enrichment
### Goal: Nexus becomes the complete community platform

- [ ] File sharing (hosted on the node, no central CDN)
- [ ] Collaborative whiteboard (real-time via WebSocket)
- [ ] Lightweight task system (Trello-like, per community)
- [ ] Local Ollama AI — knowledge assistant (indexes local forum)
- [ ] **Nexus Guard Protocol — TypeScript integration**: migrate toxicity scoring engine into `nexus-core/src/socket/index.ts` as a `chat:send` middleware — score 0–10, configurable threshold via `.env`, logged to DB
- [ ] Guard Protocol — configurable threshold via admin panel (no restart)
- [ ] Guard Protocol — reliable URL blocking (regex + configurable whitelist)
- [ ] Plugin marketplace — stable API for third-party extensions
- [ ] Distributed data sharding for large files (inspired by IPFS/BitTorrent — voluntary nodes)

---

## PHASE 5 — Mobile and reputation
### Goal: Nexus in everyone's pocket

- [ ] iOS app via Capacitor
- [ ] Android app via Capacitor
- [ ] Desktop via Tauri (.exe/.app/.sh ~10MB, standalone)
- [ ] NexusPoints — inter-instance community reputation system
- [ ] Badges and levels
- [ ] Documented public API for third-party developers

---

## ROADMAP RULES

1. Don't start a phase without the previous one being stable and in use
2. Don't break what works — propose alternatives (e.g. Relay vs CF Tunnel vs open ports)
3. Complexity is hidden: the user sees a button, the Rust layer handles the complexity
4. Every addition must be consistent with the decentralized and sovereign aspect
5. The core stays simple. Complexity goes into plugins.
6. The community can vote to reprioritize future phases

---

## WHAT'S NEVER IN THE ROADMAP

- Advertising
- Data selling
- Features that require a **mandatory** central server (`nexusnode.app` is optional — without it, the instance remains fully functional on its own domain)
- Backdoors of any kind
- Permanent dependency on a proprietary third-party service
- Replacing Node.js or SvelteKit with Rust (every tool in its place)

---

*Version 1.6 — March 2, 2026*
*"P2P is the soul. Rust is the body."*
