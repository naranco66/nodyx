### Phase 1 success criteria ✅
A non-developer can:
1. Install Nexus on their server in under 15 minutes ✅
2. Configure their instance via the interactive installer ✅
3. Create categories, threads, and tags ✅
4. Manage their community via the admin panel ✅
5. Be found on Google ✅

---

## PHASE 2 — Real-time Chat + Directory + Network Identity ✅ COMPLETE
### Goal: Members communicate live, the directory is real, each instance has its URL

### 2.1 Real-time chat ✅
- [x] WebSocket (Socket.io) integrated into Fastify v5
- [x] Text channels configurable by admin
- [x] Real-time notifications (WebSocket — replaces 30s polling)
- [x] Message history persisted in PostgreSQL

### 2.2 nexusnode.app — Directory ✅
- [x] Real global directory service — instance registration API
- [x] /communities page fed by the real directory (end of mock)
- [x] Automatic instance registration on first startup
- [x] Automatic ping every 5 minutes (live member count, online stats)

### 2.3 Network identity — `slug.nexusnode.app` ✅
- [x] Each instance chooses a unique slug at installation
- [x] The slug is reserved with the nexusnode.app directory (REST API)
- [x] Wildcard DNS `*.nexusnode.app` managed by our Cloudflare
- [x] Caddy routes `slug.nexusnode.app → node IP` (Cloudflare Origin Certificate)
- [x] Admin has no DNS to configure — clean URL in 1 click

### 2.4 Voice channels — Network layer ✅
- [x] coturn server (STUN/TURN) configured and started by `install.sh`
- [x] WebRTC signaling via Socket.io (`src/socket/voice.ts`)
- [x] VoicePanel.svelte — floating bar + mic/camera/screen share controls
- [x] VoiceSettings.svelte — configurable AudioContext chain
- [x] MediaCenter.svelte — screen sharing + clips

---

## PHASE 3 — P2P Infrastructure + Rust Foundation
### Goal: Break free from third-party network dependencies. Build the decentralized core.

> *"P2P is the soul. Rust is the body."*
>
> Nexus will not replace Node.js or SvelteKit — they do their job perfectly.
> Rust will come **underneath**, invisible to the user, to handle the parts
> that JavaScript can't do well: low-level networking, encryption, WireGuard, DHT.
> The Rust layer communicates with nexus-core via a local Unix socket — simple and decoupled.

---

### 3.0 — `nexus-p2p`: The Rust Foundation 🔨 IN PROGRESS

#### Why Rust here?

Today, a user without a domain and without open ports must:
1. Create a Cloudflare account
2. Add their domain to Cloudflare (requires owning one, ~$1/year)
3. Configure `cloudflared` manually or via `install_tunnel.sh`

That's too much friction. And more importantly: **it's a dependency on a third-party service**,
contrary to Nexus's philosophy.

The Rust layer solves this radically and progressively.

#### Phase 3.0-A — `nexus-relay-client` ✅ VALIDATED — March 1, 2026

> Replaces `install_tunnel.sh` + Cloudflare Tunnel. Zero domain required. Zero open ports.
> **Tested in real conditions: Raspberry Pi 4, no open ports, no Cloudflare account.**

- [x] Static Rust binary (9MB) — `tokio` + `hyper` + `tokio-postgres` + `clap` + `dashmap`
- [x] Outbound TCP connection to `relay.nexusnode.app:7443` (our infrastructure)
- [x] Bidirectional HTTP forwarding (JSON framing, 4-byte length prefix)
- [x] Automatic `slug.nexusnode.app` registration without DNS or CF account
- [x] Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → max 30s)
- [x] GitHub Release `v0.1.0-relay` — amd64 + arm64 binaries
- [x] Integration in `install.sh`: option 2 "Nexus Relay (recommended)"
- [x] Client-side systemd service (`nexus-relay-client.service`)

**User result:** `bash install.sh` → choose "Relay" → get `mycommunity.nexusnode.app` **with zero network configuration**.

#### Phase 3.0-B — `nexus-turn` (replaces coturn)

> coturn is a 2000s C project. Complex to configure, significant attack surface.

- [ ] STUN/TURN server in Rust — RFC 5766 + RFC 8656
- [ ] Dynamic credentials provided by nexus-core via IPC (no static config)
- [ ] Structured logs (JSON), Prometheus metrics
- [ ] ~5MB static, zero configuration at install

#### Phase 3.0-C — `nexus-p2p` core (long-term vision)

> The distributed core. When a node wants to contact another node directly, without going through us.

- [ ] Kademlia DHT (via `libp2p`) — peer discovery without central server
- [ ] WireGuard (via `wireguard-rs`) — encrypted direct tunnel between voluntary instances
- [ ] Native ICE/STUN — NAT traversal without coturn for P2P connections
- [ ] IPC API exposed to nexus-core: `relay.register(slug)`, `peer.connect(slug)`, `network.peers()`
- [ ] If `nexusnode.app` is unreachable, nodes find each other via DHT (resilience)

---

### 3.1 — Voice Channels — Interface & Advanced Modes
*(network layer already in place — Phase 2.4)*

- [ ] Complete voice channel interface (join/leave, participant list)
- [ ] Round Table mode — direct WebRTC P2P (2 to 8 people, low latency)
- [ ] Amphitheater mode — 1→N broadcast (9 to 25+ people, video on "screen")
- [ ] Nodes-as-a-Service — a Raspberry Pi can become a media relay to relieve the main server

### 3.2 — Inter-instance mesh network
*(depends on Phase 3.0-C)*

- [ ] WireGuard mesh between voluntary instances — end-to-end encrypted tunnel
- [ ] DHT for peer discovery without a central server
- [ ] Gossip protocol — lightweight metadata synchronization between nodes
- [ ] Distributed backup directory — if `nexusnode.app` goes down, nodes maintain the directory
- [ ] Automatic transition to direct P2P connection when available
- [ ] Lightweight federation — a member of community A can interact with community B

---

## PHASE 4 — Platform enrichment
### Goal: Nexus becomes the complete community platform

- [ ] File sharing (hosted on the node, no central CDN)
- [ ] Collaborative whiteboard (real-time via WebSocket)
- [ ] Lightweight task system (Trello-like, per community)
- [ ] Local Ollama AI — knowledge assistant (indexes local forum)
- [ ] **Nexus Guard Protocol — TypeScript integration**: migrate toxicity scoring engine into `nexus-core/src/socket/index.ts` as a `chat:send` middleware — score 0–10, configurable threshold via `.env`, logged to DB
- [ ] Guard Protocol — configurable threshold via admin panel (no restart)
- [ ] Guard Protocol — reliable URL blocking (regex + configurable whitelist)
- [ ] Plugin marketplace — stable API for third-party extensions
- [ ] Distributed data sharding for large files (inspired by IPFS/BitTorrent — voluntary nodes)

---

## PHASE 5 — Mobile and reputation
### Goal: Nexus in everyone's pocket

- [ ] iOS app via Capacitor
- [ ] Android app via Capacitor
- [ ] Desktop via Tauri (.exe/.app/.sh ~10MB, standalone)
- [ ] NexusPoints — inter-instance community reputation system
- [ ] Badges and levels
- [ ] Documented public API for third-party developers

---

## ROADMAP RULES

1. Don't start a phase without the previous one being stable and in use
2. Don't break what works — propose alternatives (e.g. Relay vs CF Tunnel vs open ports)
3. Complexity is hidden: the user sees a button, the Rust layer handles the complexity
4. Every addition must be consistent with the decentralized and sovereign aspect
5. The core stays simple. Complexity goes into plugins.
6. The community can vote to reprioritize future phases

---

## WHAT'S NEVER IN THE ROADMAP

- Advertising
- Data selling
- Features that require a **mandatory** central server (`nexusnode.app` is optional — without it, the instance remains fully functional on its own domain)
- Backdoors of any kind
- Permanent dependency on a proprietary third-party service
- Replacing Node.js or SvelteKit with Rust (every tool in its place)
